## Pour Over

### Notes from a workshop at [Dose Coffee & Tea](http://www.dosecoffeeandtea.com)

* 200 degree water
* medium grind
* aim for a brew time of 3:30 (from start of pour till last bit has gone through)
* for the initial pour
  * add 60g of water
  * wait about 30s for the gas to release (seen as bubbles)
* remaining pours are small bursts

Golden ratio of coffee to waterratio is 1/16.6
